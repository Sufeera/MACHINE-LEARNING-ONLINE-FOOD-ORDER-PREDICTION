This study explores predictive modeling of online food orders using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of customer orders, demographics, and time patterns, we identify trends and forecast future ordering behaviors. Our models, including regression and decision trees, reveal significant correlations between ordering times and food preferences. The findings highlight the impact of external factors like local events and weather on order volumes. This research provides valuable insights for restaurant owners and delivery services, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction in the dynamic online food market.
